# POPL-Project-1
Achieving parallelization in mips code using c++ concurrency features 
The project aims at implementing a subset of MIPS simulator. 
Which would focus on two aspects :-
1.Finding the section of code that can be parallelized and running it concurrently using threads. 
2.The c++ code will also find whether a loop can be parallelized. If yes then each iteration would run on different thread.
